# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This module serves as the foundation for all subsequent modules, introducing you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which acts as the "nervous system" for robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and manage nodes, topics, and services
- Implement Python agents using rclpy
- Design basic humanoid robot models using URDF

## Module Structure

This module contains three chapters that build upon each other:

1. **Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Learn about nodes, topics, services, and the ROS 2 communication model
2. **Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy** - Implement ROS 2 nodes using Python and the rclpy client library
3. **Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF** - Create robot models using the Unified Robot Description Format

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Why This Foundation Matters

ROS 2 provides the infrastructure for communication between different components of a robotic system. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for developing complex robotic applications, especially when working with humanoid robots that require coordination between multiple sensors, actuators, and processing units.

Let's begin with [Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./chapter-1-ros2-fundamentals.md).
