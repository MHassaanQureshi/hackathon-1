# AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to Physical AI systems and humanoid robot control. This book bridges AI agents with simulated physical environments, focusing on practical implementation.

## About This Book

This AI-Native Book is designed for advanced AI, Robotics, and CS students/developers. It covers:

- **Physical AI systems** and humanoid robot control
- **Bridging AI agents** with simulated physical environments
- **Practical implementation** using industry-standard tools and frameworks

## Book Structure

The book is organized into 4 comprehensive modules, each containing 3 focused chapters:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1-the-robotic-nervous-system)
- ROS 2 fundamentals (nodes, topics, services)
- Python agents with rclpy
- Humanoid modeling with URDF

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/module-2-the-digital-twin)
- Physics simulation in Gazebo
- High-fidelity environments in Unity
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth, IMU)

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](/docs/module-3-the-ai-robot-brain)
- Isaac Sim and synthetic data
- Isaac ROS and VSLAM
- Navigation and path planning with Nav2

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/module-4-vision-language-action)
- Voice commands with OpenAI Whisper
- LLM-based task planning
- Capstone: autonomous humanoid robot

## Learning Approach

Each module builds progressively, ensuring knowledge accumulation. You'll find:

- **Clear learning objectives** at the beginning of each chapter
- **Hands-on exercises** and practical examples
- **Technical implementation guides** with code samples
- **Integration patterns** between different technologies

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1](/docs/module-1-the-robotic-nervous-system) to establish foundational knowledge that all other modules build upon. Each module is designed to be completed in sequence for optimal learning.
