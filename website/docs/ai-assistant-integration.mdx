# AI Assistant Integration

This page demonstrates how to integrate the AI assistant into your documentation pages.

## Using the Chat Interface

You can embed the AI assistant directly in your pages to provide interactive help related to the content:

import ChatInterface from '@site/src/components/ChatInterface';

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--12">
    <ChatInterface />
  </div>
</div>

## How It Works

The AI assistant is powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:

- Understands the content of the entire book
- Provides accurate answers based on the book's content
- References specific modules and chapters in its responses
- Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Ask specific questions to get more targeted answers
2. **Follow Up**: Use follow-up questions to dive deeper into topics
3. **Check Sources**: Review the sources provided in the responses to find related content
4. **Explore**: Use the assistant to discover related concepts in the book

## Example Questions

Try asking the assistant questions like:

- "Explain the difference between ROS 1 and ROS 2"
- "How do I create a publisher node in rclpy?"
- "What are the key components of URDF?"
- "Explain how Gazebo simulates physics"
- "What is VSLAM and how is it used in robotics?"

The AI assistant will provide answers based on the book content and reference the specific chapters where you can find more information.
